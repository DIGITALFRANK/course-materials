# course-materials
lecture slides, notes, quizzes, exams, code from old courses I've taught (of course, all errors are my own)

General notes: 

I have only posted one version of each item (usually there are multiple versions of each quiz and exam).

Quizzes are short in-class exercise sets. They typically have 3-5 questions on them, and, depending on the quiz, were given 20-30 minutes for completion. 

All materials have been greatly generalized to remove all displayed course-specific information (rooms, times, grading procedures, etc.). What remains is suitable for self-study.

Any mistakes are my own.

Amidst all the other freely-available materials online, I hope these help a few of you students looking for more practice problems, or some professors that want some prepared materials their students haven't seen yet.
