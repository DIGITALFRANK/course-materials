# course-materials
lecture slides, notes, quizzes, exams, code from some courses I've taught

General notes: 

I have only posted one version of each item (usually there are multiple versions of each quiz and exam, and all materials change slightly as time goes on).

Quizzes are short in-class exercise sets. They typically have 3-5 questions on them, and, depending on the quiz, were given 20-45 minutes for completion, depending on the computational complexity.

Exams are given for an entire class period, typically 75-100 minutes.

All materials have been greatly generalized to remove all displayed course-specific information (rooms, times, grading procedures, etc.). What remains is suitable for self-study.

Any mistakes are my own.

Amidst all the other freely-available materials online, I hope these help a few of you students looking for more practice problems, or some professors that want some prepared materials their students haven't seen yet.
